# AI-Wednesday 01: Creating the 2026 plan for AI Wednesday while reflecting on the past year activities and improvement areas

![2025 Statistics](../assets/images/AIWednesday-statistics.png)

AI Wednesday saw a successful run in 2025, marking a huge jump in both the consistency and quality of sessions taken. Among the total **53 total sessions** taken, **31 AI Wednesday sessions** were taken this year with around **188 unique attendees** and **12 Organisers**

Though consistency during the later half of 2025 has improved, the major challenge remains the less number of hosts to take the sessions. The focus on the topics for the sessions have also switched to a much detailed approach leading to a higher involvement of more serious participants.
