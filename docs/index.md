# Welcome to AI Wednesday ✨

**AI Wednesday** is a weekly, community-driven gathering at **TinkerSpace**, focused on exploring, understanding, and building with Artificial Intelligence. It brings together students, makers, developers, designers, and curious minds who want to learn AI by doing, not just listening.

Each session may have a planned topic, project sharing, or demo, or it may evolve organically based on the questions and interests of the people who show up. The format stays flexible to encourage open discussion, hands-on experimentation, and collaborative learning.

Whether you’re curious about how AI works, experimenting with tools like LLMs, building small prototypes, or just starting out, AI Wednesday is an open space to learn, question, and build together.
