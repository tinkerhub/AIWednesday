# Welcome to AI Wednesday ✨

**Maker Thursday** is a weekly, community-driven gathering at **TinkerSpace**, bringing together makers, tinkerers, students, and curious minds to connect, share, and build.

Each session may have a planned topic, project sharing, or demo or it may evolve organically based on the interests of the people who show up. The format stays flexible to encourage open discussion, hands-on making, and spontaneous collaboration.

Whether you are into electronics, hardware hacking, software, fabrication, or just starting out, Maker Thursday is an open space to learn, experiment, and build together.
