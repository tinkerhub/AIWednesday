The initial discussions for the event began during a Maker Thursday session, and the planning, coordination, and finalization were all carried out within the same Maker Thursday gatherings. Even the speakers were selected from community members who volunteered to contribute. As part of this effort, we received a Raspberry Pi 16GB and a 1-year free subscription to Raspberry Pi Magazine. We are truly proud of this achievement, it reflects a community-driven initiative, built by the community, for the community.</p> </li> <li> <p>Arduino Day 2025 Similar to Raspberry Pi Jam, Arduino Day 2025 was also organized collaboratively with TinkerSpace community members and MakerGram. The idea and planning originated from Maker Thursday discussions, with community members volunteering as speakers and contributors. Blog Post , Event Page.</p> </li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>Space Carnival Badge : Creating a PCB badge had been a long-term plan for us, and we finally brought it to life at the end of the year during TinkerSpace\u2019s 3rd anniversary Space Carnival. The badge was intentionally simple, using LEDs and batteries, giving curious participants an opportunity to try soldering and build their own badge.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/2026/01/10/maker-thursday-0x00/#future-plans","title":"Future Plans","text":"<p>During the review and planning discussion, we aligned on the following actions for the coming year:</p> <ul> <li>Topic Planning: Topics and hosts should be confirmed at least one week in advance. If not ready, a filler topic will be used and an available member will host.</li> <li>Documentation: From 2026 onwards, every Maker Thursday will be documented. The host is responsible for a short journal entry, following simple guidelines, giving visibility to both the host and the community.</li> <li>Filler Topics: Preselected topics like KiCad and MQTT will be used when needed, with more added over time.</li> <li>Collaborative Projects: Encourage community-driven hardware projects, with support through curation and mentorship.</li> <li>Maker Bench Integration: Explore ways to bring Maker Bench projects into Maker Thursday to increase participation.</li> <li>Physical AI Collaboration: Work with AI Wednesday to explore Physical AI, focusing on AI running on hardware.</li> <li>Personal Goals: Encourage members to set personal maker goals, such as publishing projects in Raspberry Pi Magazine or other international platforms.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/2026/01/10/maker-thursday-0x00/#this-weeks-project-presentation","title":"This Week\u2019s Project Presentation","text":"<p>Ramakanth shared Meow Synth, an ESP32-based mini synthesizer.
